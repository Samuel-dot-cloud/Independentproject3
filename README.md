# PROJECT NAME.
The project is titled "The horology master". It basically does as the title suggests.For more information on how the project works, check out the following link:https://samuel-dot-cloud.github.io/Independent-project2/
## PROJECT DESCRIPTION.
The project is basically a webpage that requires you to key in essential information concerning your gender and birthday, after which it calculates and finds out the day you were born, and then proceeds to give you an Akan name, using a naming system found in West Africa. Hence it gives people the opportunity to find out the actual day they were born on, and hands you a name as another priviledge.
### AUTHOR INFORMATION.
My name is Samuel Dot, currently a programmer at Moringa School who believes in efficiency through work.
### SETUP INSTRUCTIONS.
The project makes use of HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, and JavaScript in order to make it work. It also requires advanced coding software such as Atom and Visual Studio Code.More programming was also done through use of JsFiddle which enabled me to test out my JavaScript code to ensure it worked seamlessly.
### BDD.
When the project was still in a planning phase, it was thought up with the intention of having the ability to solve a person's problem of getting to know their birthday through use of custom JavaScript code. In order to arrive at this, it had to be able to process input about one's gender and birthday to be able to hand them their right Akan name, based on the day they were born. First and foremost was to find a method to ensure that a person gave a correct gender, and next was to ensure that the correct date and day could be arrived upon.
### TECHNOLOGIES USED.
The project can run on any browser whose edition is later than 2015, as the project makes use of JavaScript concepts that were introduced in 2015.The project can run on most phones, tablets, and laptops, so long as they have a highly dedicated processor.
### CONTACT INFORMATION.
