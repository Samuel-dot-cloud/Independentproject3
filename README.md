## PROJECT DESCRIPTION.
The project is basically a webpage that requires you to key in essential information concerning your name and email, after which it sends you a confirmatory email by linking with mailchimp API. Thus, the website is able keep a record of all the subscribers it has, thus one is able to manage contacts.
### AUTHOR INFORMATION.
My name is Samuel Dot, currently a programmer at Moringa School who believes in efficiency through work.
### SETUP INSTRUCTIONS.
The project makes use of HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, Jquery and JavaScript in order to make it work. It also requires advanced coding software such as Atom and Visual Studio Code.More programming was also done through use of JsFiddle which enabled me to test out my JavaScript code to ensure it worked seamlessly.
### BDD.
When the project was still in a planning phase, it was thought up with the intention of having the ability to collect a user's information then relaying a confirmatory message of their subscription. The project also had to keep a record of the people who were able to subscribe thus ensuring that that the web designer has a workable list. The project also had to present information about the developers' capabilities in a visually stimulating method through use of Jquery.
### TECHNOLOGIES USED.
The project can run on any browser whose edition is later than 2015, as the project makes use of JavaScript concepts that were introduced in 2015.The project can run on most phones, tablets, and laptops, so long as they have a highly dedicated processor.
### CONTACT INFORMATION.
